## the transmissor
it's an embedd system base, a raspberry pi with some add elements who help us to have communication with the context ( wifi and a sound imput) with the streamming server (code) and one direction communication with the plattaform by sending meta data. 

actual stage: we are working on the v2, working very nice!

## the server
a linux code base streamming server, wich is hidden in "el merdado de la merced" in mexico city, protected by the people from the mercado. the aim is to have a free speach and a non censurship streamming server

actual stage: working very nice! and trying to know how many tm we can host and when it will be crashed


## the plattaform
it's a webpage wich host:
 — tutorial that explain step by step of how to make a transmissor (video + text + links + forum)
 — basic information (contact + statement + faq)
 — menu of all internet stations from the people who has build or has a tm ready to listen (image + name + location + basic information     + podcast result from transmissions)
 
 actual stage: we need your help!
